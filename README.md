WS2812B Halo
=============

This simple board features 24 WS2812B integrated LEDs and drivers arranged circularly. 

The interior cut may be resized or removed entirely to vary the disk. Watch your traces : )

Other circular arrangements may be calculated using the Positions.ods spreadsheet. Enjoy.
